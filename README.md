### Objectives From Each Lecture

###### L01
* Be able to count the best-case and worst-case number of primitive operations in a method that uses loops, if statements, and return statements.
* Understand the distinction between interface and implementation, and the corresponding distinction between abstract data types and their implementations.

###### L02
* Understand the motivation behind asymptotic runtime analysis.
* Be able to take an operation count, in terms of input size n, and determine the big-O runtime class it belongs to.

###### L03
* Be able to analyze an algorithmâ€™s correctness using a given loop invariant.
* Be able to describe in words, implement using a loop invariant, and analyze the runtime of insertion and selection sort.
* Know the definition and uses of preconditions and postconditions.


###### L04
* Understand how recursive methods are *executed*.
* Be able to understand and develop recursive methods *without* thinking about how they are executed.

###### L05
* Know the generic steps of a divide-and- conquer algorithm.
* Thoroughly understand the mechanism of mergesort and quicksort.
* Be prepared to implement merge and partition helper methods.

###### L06
* Thoroughly understand the mechanism of mergesort and quicksort.
* Be prepared to implement merge and partition helper methods.
* Know how to determine whether a sort is in-place and stable.

###### L07
* Understand the distinction between comparison and non-comparison sorts.
* Know the runtime and other tradeoffs between O(n log n) comparison sorts and radix sort.
* Be prepared to implement radix sort.

###### L08
* Understand the definition of a tree.
* Know the basic terminolog associated with trees:
    * Root, child, parent, leaf, height, depth, subtree, descendant, ancestor.
* Be able to write a tree class and simple recursive processing methods.
    * descendent, ancestor

###### L09
* Know the definition and uses of a binary search tree.
* Be prepared to implement, and know the runtime of, the following BST operations:
    * searching
    * inserting
    * deleting

###### L10
* Know what a balanced BST is and why we want it.
* Be able to implement rotations in BSTs

###### L11
* Know the definition of balance factor.
* Know the definition of an AVL tree.

###### L12
* Be able to implement AVL rebalancing.

###### L13
* Understand how public and private members in Java reflect the separation between interface and implementation.
* Understand the purpose and interface of the Set ADT, and how AVL trees implement it.

###### L14
* Understand the purpose and interface of the Priority Queue ADT.
* Know the how the add, peek, and poll operations of a Priority Queue behave.
* Know the definition and properties of a heap.

###### L15
* Understand how to implement a Priority Queue using a heap
* Understand the storage mechanism for heaps.
* Be prepared to implement a heap's add, peek, and poll operations.
